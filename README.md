# Zara.com Inventory Change Tracker 
This is my first proper project, an attempt to create a script that will check the status of a item on zrar.com that my wife wants badly. 

## How it works:
Go to "set-current-size-list.py" and change the URL to the product you want to track changes for.
Do the same in "zara-Inventory-Change-Tracker.py".
Add your email and password to the "zara-Inventory-Change-Tracker.py" in the "send email" function

Run "set-current-size-list.py" to download the current state of zara's inventory.
Run "zara-Inventory-Change-Tracker.py"
